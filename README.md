Evolux front-end challenge.

The app mocks an API built to specification using webpack-dev-server's 'before'. That API dynamically generates a list of numbers, their cost, and their pagination, based on query input.

It then consumes from that API in a react-redux web application, listing all numbers and paginating them.

CSS is responsive.

To run:

git clone https://github.com/afcjunior/afcjunior-evolux-front-end-challenge.git
cd afcjunior-evolux-front-end-challenge
npm install
npm start
